This is a quick help for running the various steps of the analysis.
Thoses steps are 

	1) run over the samples and produce histograms and a simple TTree used for the training and reading of the BDT (TMBA),
	2) run root macros for producing automaticallu histograms of data/MC comparisons,
	3) use a sandalone class to perform the BDT training and reading,
	4) use a root macro to create templates used by Theta,
	5) run theta (WARNING : the theta cfg file is still not fully validated


The end of the readme contains a to-do list.


-----------------------------------------------------
----->Step 1)
-----------------------------------------------------

got into the TreeReader and simply execute (the directory outputroot has to exist) :

root -l runTreeReader.C


It runs automatically over all the samples and for systematics variations (predefined). To add an histogram, add a line to the "initializeHisto" function, after the line 500.

addHisto("varname",      "selection step",  sample.Data(),  nbin, xmin, xmax);


 To fill the histograms, add a line to the function "applyEventSel"
 
fillHisto(thechannel, "varname",	 "selection step",  thesample,  value,  evtweight);

After running runTreeReader.C, one has to merged all the root files into one file, for simplicity :

cd outputroot/
hadd histofile_merged.root *.root



-----------------------------------------------------
----->Step 2)
-----------------------------------------------------

go to the PlotMaker directory and simply execute :

root -l makePlots.C+

List of samples, selection steps and histograms to be produced are configurable in "makePlots.C". Histgrams are stored as gif file in the "plots" directory.



-----------------------------------------------------
----->Step 3)
-----------------------------------------------------

For training and reading the BDT, go to the "TMVA" directory and type :

root -l
root [0] .L theMVAtool.C+
root [1] theMVAtool tmva
root [2] tmva.doTraining()  # creates weight for the BDT
root [3] tmva.doReading() # read the TTree and calculate the BDT output for all events and all samples, produce templates (MVA distribution) 


After running doReading(), one has to merged all the root files into one file, for simplicity :

cd outputroot/
hadd merged_all.root *.root



-----------------------------------------------------
----->Step 4)
-----------------------------------------------------


In the TMVA directory, use the "ProdTemplate.C" macro to put the BDT distribution histograms in a shape compliant with Theta naming conventions.
Simply do :

root -l ProdTemplate.C+


-----------------------------------------------------
----->Step 5)
-----------------------------------------------------


The theta configuration file is located in the "Theta" directory. For not, it is not working properly. So don't use it.




-----------------------------------------------------
----->   TO DO 
-----------------------------------------------------

	1- in TreeMaker, add the btagging reshaping (it has to be studied and implemented).
	2- create a macro to perform data/MC comparisons of the BDT before and after the fit.
	3- in theMVAtool, give the possibility to create one template per  channel (and not one for all channels summed). It has to be configurable.
